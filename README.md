Repository for small programs and algorithm implementations. Currently present:
- Lazy Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest path (graph.h and test_graph.cpp)
- Concurrent map implementation made as an assignment in coursera course (concurrent_map.h) with a few speed tests (test_concurrent_map.cpp)
- Custom implementation of standard list container with iterators (in progress)
- Implementation of diff utility (more test cases required)
